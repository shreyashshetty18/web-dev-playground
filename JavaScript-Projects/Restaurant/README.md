- Menu section with image cards and price
- Food categories with hover reveal
- Testimonial section and contact form UI
- Smooth scrolling using a small jQuery snippet

## 🧩 Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, flexbox)
- JavaScript (jQuery for smooth scrolling)

## 📁 Project structure

```
Restaurant/
├─ index.html          # Main page

```

## ✅ Notes & suggestions

- Images are hotlinked — replace with local assets for production.
- Consider converting the jQuery smooth-scroll to vanilla JS if you want to remove the dependency.
- Accessibility and form handling (validation, submit) can be added as next steps.
