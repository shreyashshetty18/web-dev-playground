# Fine Dine Resto 🍽️

A simple, responsive restaurant landing page built with plain HTML, CSS and a small bit of JavaScript for smooth scrolling. It showcases food categories, a menu list, testimonials and a contact form — great as a front-end demo or starter template.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive layout with mobile-first considerations
- Menu section with image cards and price
- Food categories with hover reveal
- Testimonial section and contact form UI
- Smooth scrolling using a small jQuery snippet

## 🧩 Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom properties, flexbox)
- JavaScript (jQuery for smooth scrolling)

## ▶️ Run locally

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser OR serve a local static server (recommended for testing links):

```bash
# using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# or using node's serve (if installed)
serve .
```

## 📁 Project structure

```

├─ index.html          # Main page
├─ style.css           # Styles

```

## ✅ Notes & suggestions

- Images are hotlinked — replace with local assets for production.
- Consider converting the jQuery smooth-scroll to vanilla JS if you want to remove the dependency.
- Accessibility and form handling (validation, submit) can be added as next steps.
