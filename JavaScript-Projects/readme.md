# JavaScript Projects ✨

Welcome to the **JavaScript-Projects** folder — a place for small, hands-on HTML/CSS/JavaScript practice projects. This collection is meant for learning, experimentation, and building short, focused projects that help you level up front-end skills.

---

## What you'll find here 🔍

- Small, single-purpose projects built with **vanilla JavaScript**, plain HTML, and CSS.
- Each project lives in its own folder and includes a short `README` where needed.
- Example project folders: `E-Commerce/` and additional practice projects you add.

## How to add a new project ➕

Follow this simple structure for each new project:

```
my-new-project/
  ├─ index.html
  ├─ style.css
  ├─ script.js        
  └─ README.md        (brief description and instructions)
```

Tips:
- Use a short, descriptive folder name (kebab-case preferred): `image-slider`, `todo-app`.
- Keep projects small and focused—one main idea per project.
- Add a short `README.md` describing the goal, features, and how to run it (open `index.html` in the browser or use Live Server).

---

## Best practices ✅

- Keep HTML semantic and accessible.
- Organize CSS with clear class names; consider a simple naming scheme (BEM if you like).
- Write small, well-scoped JS modules or functions and prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Add comments where logic may not be immediately obvious.

---

## Running & Testing 🧪

- Open `index.html` directly in the browser for quick checks.
- For a better dev experience, use a live-reload server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension).
- Test in multiple browsers if the project involves non-trivial browser APIs.

---

## Ideas & Inspiration 💡

- Image carousel / slider
- Todo list with localStorage
- Modal or tooltip component
- Simple games (Memory, Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Small CSS + JS visual effects (neumorphism, glassmorphism, animations)

Happy coding! 🚀
