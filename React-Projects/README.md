# React Projects — Experiments & Learning Lab 🚀

**Purpose**

This folder is a playground for experimenting with React: building small projects, trying out patterns, testing new libraries, and learning concepts hands‑on.

---

## What you'll find here 🔍

- Small, self-contained React projects (each should live in its own subfolder)
- Notes and examples for React concepts: hooks, context, router, state management, testing, and more
- Short experiments to verify behavior or demonstrate techniques

---


## Concepts & techniques to experiment with 💡

- useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useMemo
- Custom hooks and hook composition
- Context API vs external state (Redux / Zustand / Recoil)
- Routing with React Router
- Forms, validation, and controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
- Component composition and render-props/HOCs
- CSS strategies: plain CSS, CSS Modules, styled-components / emotion
- Testing with Jest + React Testing Library
- Performance profiling and memoization
- Deployment (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

---

## Contributing & Notes ✍️

- Keep experiments small and focused. Prefer one idea per project folder.
- If you add dependencies, document why they were added in the project `README.md`.
- Include links to any reference articles, docs, or tutorials you used.
