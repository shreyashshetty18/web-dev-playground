# Spotlight Effect

This project demonstrates a simple spotlight effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Live Demo : https://spotlight-hover-effect.netlify.app/

## Features
- A background image with a dynamic spotlight that follows the mouse cursor.
- The spotlight is created using a CSS radial gradient, controlled by custom properties (`--x` and `--y`).
- JavaScript updates the spotlight position in real-time as the user moves the mouse.

## How It Works
- The `box` div covers the entire viewport and applies a radial gradient that simulates a spotlight.
- Mouse movement events update the CSS variables to move the spotlight to the cursor's position.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `style.css`: Styles for the spotlight effect and background.
- `script.js`: Handles mouse movement and updates the spotlight position.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Move your mouse around to see the spotlight follow your cursor.

Feel free to modify the background image or spotlight size in the CSS for different effects.
