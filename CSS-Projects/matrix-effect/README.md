# Matrix Text Effect

This project demonstrates a Matrix-style text scramble animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Animated text scramble effect on mouse hover.
- Each character in the text is replaced with a random letter (A–Z, a–z) for a dynamic, hacker-style animation.
- Simple and beginner-friendly code using basic DOM manipulation and events.

## How It Works
- The main text is displayed in a styled paragraph.
- When the user hovers over the text, JavaScript rapidly replaces each character with a random letter, creating a scrambling effect.
- The effect is achieved using `setInterval` and array mapping.

## Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `style.css`: Styles for the Matrix effect and layout.
- `script.js`: Handles the text scramble animation on hover.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Hover your mouse over the text to see the Matrix scramble effect.

Feel free to modify the text, animation speed, or character set in the JavaScript for different effects.
